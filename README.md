1940- Stibitz demonstrated The Complex Number Calculator at an American Mathematical Society conference held at Darthmouth College. Stibitz stunned the group by performing calculations remotely on the CNC (located in New York) using a Teletype terminal connected to New York over special telephone lines. This was likely the first example of remote access computing. 
1941- Konrad Zuse finishes the Z3 computer. 
1942- The Atanasoff- Berry computer(ABC) is completed.
1943- The US Army asks Bell Laboratories to design a machine to assist in testing its M-9 gun director, a type of analog computer that aims large guns to their targets. Mathematician George Stibitz recommends using a relay-based calculator for the project. The result was the Relay Interpolator, later called the Bell Labs Model II. The Relay Interpolator used 440 relays, and since it was programmable by paper tape, was used for other applications following the war.

1944- Harvard Mark 1 is completed by Harvard physics professor Howard Aiken, and designed and built by IBM, the Harvard Mark 1 is a room-sized, relay-based calculator. The machine had a fifty-foot long camshaft running the length of the machine that synchronized the machine’s thousands of component parts and used 3,500 relays. The Mark 1 produced mathematical tables but was soon superseded by electronic stored-program computers.

1949- Modems were developed in 1949 for transmitting radar signals by Jack Harrington’s group at the Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC) near Boston, the modem modulates digital data into sounds, and demodulates received sounds into digital data. 
  
1956- At MIT, researchers begin experimenting with direct keyboard input to computers, a precursor to today´s normal mode of operation.
 
1957 – Russia puts Sputnik into orbit.
1958 – Space exploration assigned to Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
1958 – NASA opens for business via Eisenhower executive order.
1961 – Leonard Kleinrock of MIT wrote the first paper on packet switching theory.
1962 – J.C.R. Licklider of MIT writes memos on “Galactic Network Concept”
1965- ARPA sponsors study on cooperative network of time-sharing computers.
1968- Network Working Group, headed by Steve Crocker, loosely organized to develop host level protocols for communication over the ARPANET. 
1969 – Larry Roberts heads the project that connects first two ARPANET sites – UCLA and Stanford Research Institute.
1972 – Bob Kahn demonstrates ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC) 
1972 – Ray Tomlinson discovered the first basic email program using “@”
1973- Bob Metcalfe's Harvard PhD Thesis outlines idea for Ethernet. The concept was tested on Xerox PARC's Alto computers, and the first Ethernet network called the Alto Aloha System 
1974- BBN opens Telenet, the first public packet data service, a commercial version of ARPANET.
1975- First ARPANET mailing list, MsgGroup, is created by Steve Walker. John Vittal develops MSG, the first all-inclusive email program providing replying, forwarding, and filing capabilities.
1979- ARPA establishes the Internet Configuration Control Board. 
1980- ARPANET grinds to a complete halt because of an accidentally-propagated status-message virus

Stibitz stunned the group by performing calculations remotely on the CNC (located in New York) using a Teletype terminal connected to New York over special telephone lines. This was likely the first example of remote access computing. 
1 . *< !doctype html >*: A doctype declaration which tells the browser that the document is using HTML.
1941- Konrad Zuse finishes the Z3 computer. 
2 . *< html class="no-js" lang="" >* : The "no-js" class gets removed by a Javascript library (Modernizr), 
   and this gets replaced with a js class. When Modernizr loads, it replaces no-js with js.
      
   This is a way to style with OR without Javascript.
   
   In other words, CSS styles can be defined for JavaScript-enabled browsers and for browsers that 
   have JavaScript disabled. lang="" sets the language of the web page.
1942- The Atanasoff- Berry computer(ABC) is completed.

1943- The US Army asks Bell Laboratories to design a machine to assist in testing its M-9 gun director, a type of analog computer that aims large guns to their targets. Mathematician George Stibitz recommends using a relay-based calculator for the project. The result was the Relay Interpolator, later called the Bell Labs Model II.

The Mark 1 produced mathematical tables but was soon superseded by electronic stored-program computers.
3 . *< head >*: HTML tag also known as an element that is the container for all head elements. can have
   document title, styles, and other inforrmation. information about the web page itself. 
   
   < element > = opening tag
   
   < /element > = closing tag 
1949- Modems were developed in 1949 for transmitting radar signals by Jack Harrington’s group at the Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC) near Boston, the modem modulates digital data into sounds, and demodulates received sounds into digital data. 
  
1956- At MIT, researchers begin experimenting with direct keyboard input to computers, a precursor to today´s normal mode of operation.
 
1957 – Russia puts Sputnik into orbit.
4 . *< meta charset="utf-8" >* : Universal text format 8 for all languages (except Asian languages) that 
   read left to right.
1958 – Space exploration assigned to Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
5 . < title> </ title > : The title of the webpage goes in between <title></title>. 
   ex: < title >Web Page Title</ title>
   
6 . < meta name="description" content="" > : Meta stands for metadata or information about specific data.
   <meta> gives metadata of a HTML document. Metadata does not get displayed on a page, but it will 
   instead be machine parsable
   
   Meta tags/elements are used to specify things like page description, a document's author, keywords,
   last modified (as well as other metadata), how to display/reload the content of a page, and search 
   engine keywords   
   
   Users can set the viewpoint of a website 
   
7 . < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" > : This is used by the browser to 
   render a web page the size of a device's screen used to view it  
   width = width of virtual viewport of device
   device-width = physical width of device's screen 
   initial-scale = 1 is the initial zoom. 1 is normal (without zooming in) 
   
8 . < link rel="manifest" href="site.webmanifest" > : information about the application (name, author, icon,
   description, and how the application should behave once installed in a device) in a JSON text file. 
   informs details for websites installed on the homescreen of a device. web app manifests are websites that 
   can be installed to a device's homescreen without an app store, the capability to work offlien, and receive
   push notifications 
    
   linking a web manifest to a web page
1958 – NASA opens for business via Eisenhower executive order.

1961 – Leonard Kleinrock of MIT wrote the first paper on packet switching theory.

1962 – J.C.R. Licklider of MIT writes memos on “Galactic Network Concept”

1965- ARPA sponsors study on cooperative network of time-sharing computers.

1968- Network Working Group, headed by Steve Crocker, loosely organized to develop host level protocols for communication over the ARPANET. 

1969 – Larry Roberts heads the project that connects first two ARPANET sites – UCLA and Stanford Research Institute.

1972 – Bob Kahn demonstrates ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC) 
9 . < link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icon.png" > : provides back up name and an icon for the web page.
   it is the image that one can see if if the website is added to the home screen of a device 
   
10 .   < link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css" > : the rel attribue speciefies the relationship btween the
      html file with the normalize.css file that are being linked. b/c normalize.css is a stylesheet, I have to specify 
      rel = 'stylesheet' the href attribute specifies the location of the file named normalize.css file. in this case, 
      it's inside the folder named 'css' that is inside the folder of the html file that I am using. as a result, 
      href = 'css/normalize.css'
1972 – Ray Tomlinson discovered the first basic email program using “@”

1973- Bob Metcalfe's Harvard PhD Thesis outlines idea for Ethernet. The concept was tested on Xerox PARC's Alto computers, and the first Ethernet network called the Alto Aloha System 
11 .   < link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css" > : coding a link element referring to an external style sheet.
      this is a separate file that has the CSS for the web page. href attributes get usually coded with the URL relative
      to the current file 
1974- BBN opens Telenet, the first public packet data service, a commercial version of ARPANET.
12.    < meta name="theme-color" content="#fafafa" > : add a meta tag to the web page using "theme color" and set the 
      color to to a valid CSS color in this case #fafafa (the color hex composed of 98% red, 98% green, and 98% blue). 
      In this case the color hex (light grey) is applied to the browser 
  
13.   </head> : closing head tag of the head element. the < head > element is a container for all the head elements
      the < head > element can include a title for the scripts, styles, document, meta information, etc.
      
      The following tags, or elements, can go inside the < head > element: 
      < title > : defines the title of the document in the browser toolbar, provides a title for the page once added to 
                  favorites, and displays a title for the page in the results from a search engine
      < style > : to define the style information for an HTML document 
      < base > : used for specifying a default URL & default target for all links on a page
      < link > : link to an external style sheet
      < meta > : provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata does not get displayed on the page, but it will be
                 machine parsable 
      < script > : to define a client-side script in JavaScript. it has scripting statements, or it points to an 
                   external script file through the sr attribute. Uses for JavaScript are the manipulation of images,
                   validation of form, and changing of contents dynamically
      < noscript > : defines alternate content for users that have scripts as disabled or are using a browser that 
                     does not support scripts 
    
    
    
* body = element
